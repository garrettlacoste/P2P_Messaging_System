# 🔐 P2P Messaging System

This is a secure peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging system written in C++. The project enables direct communication between clients over a network using socket-based communication and basic encryption.

> **Note:** This is a forked version of the original project. I enhanced and expanded the functionality to include encryption, error handling, and user-friendly interface improvements.

## ✨ Features

- Direct client-to-client communication over TCP sockets
- AES-256 encryption for secure message exchange
- Error handling for socket and I/O operations
- Modular codebase for easier debugging and extension
- Console-based UI for sending and receiving messages

## 👨‍💻 My Contributions

As part of my coursework and interest in secure systems, I made the following enhancements to the original codebase:

- 🔐 Implemented AES-256 encryption for message security
- ⚠️ Added error-checking and validation on socket connections
- 📄 Refactored code for readability and modularity
- 🛠 Fixed memory leaks and streamlined input handling
- 🧪 Developed test cases to ensure reliable message transfer

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- C++
- Socket programming (Berkeley sockets / POSIX)
- OpenSSL (for encryption)
- Multi-threading (for concurrent send/receive)
